### Author: Errikos Kiladis (s230231)

## Introduction

In this article, we delve into the crime trends in San Francisco District, utilizing data sourced from Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018 [Dataset](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data). Our focus is on key categories of crimes including robbery, burglary and stolen property. By analyzing these three categories, we aim to provide insights into the prevailing crime landscape in the district.

- **Robbery:**
Robbery, under the law of San Francisco city, is defined as the unlawful taking of property from a person through force or threat of force. This category encompasses crimes where individuals are directly targeted and subjected to violence or intimidation to relinquish their belongings.

- **Burglary:**
Burglary involves the unlawful entry into a building or structure with the intent to commit theft or another felony. Within the context of San Francisco's legal framework, burglary captures instances of unauthorized access to properties, residences, or commercial establishments for illicit purposes.

- **Stolen Property:**
Stolen property offenses involve the possession, receipt, or sale of items obtained through criminal means. This category covers instances where individuals are found to be in possession of stolen goods or engaged in the trafficking of stolen merchandise.

## Crime and Time

1. The data suggests that Friday experiences the highest accumulation of crimes overall. Notably, burglary exhibits more fluctuation compared to other crime categories, with a significant drop during weekends and a peak occurring on Fridays. This fluctuation may indicate varying criminal behaviors or law enforcement activities during different days of the week.

2. Analyzing the time patterns, it's observed that stolen property crimes tend to peak around 17:00 to 18:00 o'clock, while robbery shows a peaky pattern from 19:00 to 02:00 o'clock. These patterns suggest specific time frames when these crimes are more likely to occur. Additionally, when examining the data on a weekly and monthly basis, there appears to be some seasonality in crime occurrences. However, further investigation is necessary to understand the underlying factors contributing to these patterns fully.

Looking at the calendar map, it's noticeable that from 2009 to 2011, there's a slight decrease in the crimes we're examining. However, there isn't a clear pattern regarding specific dates, months, or days of the year when these crimes occur more or less frequently. This suggests that the overall trend of crime reduction during that period is more consistent than any particular day or month showing significant changes. Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind this trend and whether it continues in the following years.

## Crime and Space

The map indicates that the Southern district experiences the highest frequency of the crimes we're examining, while Reachmont appears to have the least number of crimes. However, it's important to consider that areas differ in population and size, so comparing absolute numbers of crimes may not be entirely fair. Instead, it would be beneficial to create metrics that are dimensionless, meaning they don't depend on the population or area size. These metrics could provide a more accurate comparison of crime rates across different areas, allowing for a better understanding of the relative levels of criminal activity. Examples of such metrics could include crime rates per capita or per square mile, which normalize the data to account for differences in population density and area size. This approach would enable a more meaningful assessment of the true extent of crime in each area.

## Conclusion:

By categorizing crimes under these distinct umbrellas, we gain a clearer understanding of the prevalent criminal activities within San Francisco District. Through data analysis and visualization, we aim to shed light on the dynamics of these crime trends, ultimately contributing to efforts aimed at enhancing public safety and security in the community.

In San Francisco, several factors contribute to the occurrence of criminal records. Economic disparities, poverty, and limited access to resources can lead individuals to resort to crime out of necessity. Substance abuse issues, including drug addiction and alcoholism, can impair judgment and drive individuals towards illegal activities. The city's homelessness crisis further exacerbates vulnerabilities, increasing the likelihood of involvement in criminal behavior. Untreated mental health conditions also play a role, with individuals facing challenges in accessing necessary treatment and support services. Additionally, neighborhood characteristics, such as social disorganization and exposure to violence, influence crime rates. Gang activity and systemic issues, including structural inequalities and racial disparities within the criminal justice system, further compound the problem. Understanding these underlying factors is crucial for developing effective strategies to address crime and promote community safety in San Francisco.
